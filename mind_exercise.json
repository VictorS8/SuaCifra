It is funded by the National Institutes on Aging, part of the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis program provides educational content and suggestions to improve your mindset when providing care. Getting prepared can help you as a caregiver reduce your stress and anxiety.\n\nRelaxation or mindfulness exercises are also included. Try to you find a comfortable, quiet place for each exercise. As they are completed, new ones will be unlocked. Please consider repeating the exercises that you like.\n\nWe recommend that you watch one lesson per week, which should take about 10 minutes, and practice one to three relax exercises per day, about 5 minutes each.\n\nThis program is for information only. It does not provide any medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, legal, financial, or other professional services advice. Please consult with your doctor before following any exercises of this program.\n\nWe hope that you will learn new skills, calm your mind, and enhance your caregiving experience!",

These skills may help to alleviate stress, bring you to the moment, reduce the tendency to worry, and increase your appreciation for current achievements.\n\nThe Lessons contain coping skills on how to deal with difficult caregiving situations, including useful tools, valuable information, and practical tips.\n\nThe Exercises may help you tune your mind to the present, observe your body, and bring awareness to the moment. By standing back, you may relax, pause your mind and body, have a clearer view of the situation, and enhance your well-being.\n\nYou may learn how to turn off the thinking autopilot, reduce rumination, focus on being in the present to achieve our goals, calm the mind with breathing and relaxation exercises, and improve your overall mood, when nurturing your mind and body.\n\nThe caregiver journey can be very isolated. We recommend you get support from family and friends, participate in support groups, and access resources from the Alzheimerâ€™s Association, National Institutes of Health, and other organizations.\n\nThere might be some bumps on the road ahead, but remember, you are not alone.",

Such autopilot can also play a video of things that worry us and cause rumination, anxiety, and stress.\n\nLetting the autopilot control our mind is not helpful since negative thoughts are usually more sticky than positive ones, and that may drive us into a declining spiral of unhappiness, leading to the perception that the world is against us, and life is not so good.\n\nIn such cases, we recommend turning the autopilot off, looking at the bright side, and cherishing good moments. A good strategy is to bring your attention to here and now, by practicing mindfulness exercises such as Stopping.\n\nPlease follow the Stopping and other exercises three times per day in the next seven days.",

These are some general strategies that may help you: \n* Exercise, eat healthy foods and see your doctor regularly\n* Get outside help as needed\n* Take breaks during the day\n* Be active socially and spend time with friends\n* Engage in pleasant activities, hobbies, and interests\n* Maintain your health, legal, and financial information up-to-date\n\nOther practical tips for coping with caregiving include:\n* Gain knowledge about dementia\n* Join a support group\n* Set priorities. Save energy for the â€œmust doâ€ tasks, and delegate tasks to others.\n* Get accurate information about your loved oneâ€™s level of functioning and plan accordingly.\n* Donâ€™t argue or try to rationalize through a problematic situation with a person with dementia.\n* Accept that bad days do happen. It is not your fault when your efforts donâ€™t always pay off. \n* â€œGood enough for nowâ€ results are really good enough. There is much about this disease that canâ€™t be changed or fixed.\n\nWe hope that these practical tips may help you to enhance your coping skills.",

Research has shown that caregivers themselves often are at increased risk for depression and illness, especially if they do not receive adequate support from family, friends, and the community.</p> <p>One of the biggest struggles caregivers face is dealing with the difficult behaviors, such as agitation, repetition, suspicion, confusion, and not recognizing family. Basic activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing, and eating, also become difficult to manage for both the person with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia and the caregiver.</p> <p>Having a plan for getting through the day can help caregivers cope. Many caregivers have found it helpful to use strategies for dealing with difficult behaviors and stressful situations. Through trial and error you will find that some of the following tips work, while others do not. Each person with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or dementia is unique and will respond differently, and each person changes over the course of the disease. Do the best you can, and remind yourself to take breaks.</p> </body> </html>",

As you begin to take stock of the situation, here are some tips that may help:</p><ul type='disc'><li><span class='highlight_bullet'>Ask the doctor</span> any questions you have about Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia. Find out what treatments might work best to alleviate symptoms or address behavior problems. </li> <li><span class='highlight_bullet'>Contact organizations such as the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association</span> and the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center for more information about the disease, treatment options, and caregiving resources. Some community groups may offer classes to teach caregiving, problem-solving, and management skills. Find a support group where you can share your feelings and concerns. Members of support groups often have helpful ideas or know of useful resources based on their own experiences. Online support groups make it possible for caregivers to receive support without having to leave home. </li><li><span class='highlight_bullet'>Study your day</span> to see if you can develop a routine that makes things go more smoothly. If there are times of day when the person with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia is less confused or more cooperative, plan your routine to make the most of those moments. Keep in mind that the way the person functions may change from day to day, so try to be flexible and adapt your routine as needed. </li><li><span class='highlight_bullet'>Consider using adult day care or respite services</span> to ease the day-to-day demands of caregiving. These services allow you to have a break while knowing that the person with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia is being well cared for. </li><li><span class='highlight_bullet'>Begin to plan for the future</span>. This may include getting financial and legal documents in order, investigating long-term care options, and determining what services are covered by health insurance and Medicare.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></body> </html>",
